> A simple JS web application where you can create and run DFAs (deterministic finite automata).

## How to
- Start by adding an alphabet (such as {1, 0}).
- Next, click on the canvas and add your states and transitions.
- The 'console' on the right will notify you of errors in your automata.
- Create a state on the mouse position by pressing 'Q'.
- Select a state by left-clicking on it.
- Move a state by left-clicking on a state and moving the cursor.
- Create transitions by pressing 'E' once a state is selected, and then left-clicking another state.
- Remove transitions or states by pressing 'DEL' once a state or transition is selected.
- Rename the selected state by pressing 'R'.
- Set a state as Final by pressing 'F'.
- Set a state as Start by pressing 'S'.
